# Importing data

Several tools exist for importing RNA-seq "feature counts" generated from different software into the packages of `Bioconductor`. 

One of these tools is the `tximport` package which can import and summarize transcript-level abundance estimates for transcript- and gene-level analysis. More information about using `tximport` can be found [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html).

## Tutorial data

The data for this tutorial comes from an the salivary glands of 12 *N. pustulatus* beetles, half of which were starved from 5 days. 

```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
